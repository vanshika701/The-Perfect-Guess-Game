# The-Perfect-Guess-Game
This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. When the program runs:

It randomly selects a number between 5 and 50.

The player is prompted to guess the number.

After each guess, the program provides feedback:

If the guess is too low, it asks the player to guess a higher number.

If the guess is too high, it asks the player to guess a lower number.

The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.

Once guessed correctly, the program congratulates the player and shows the number of attempts it took.

This game uses Python's random module and basic control flow (loops and conditionals) to provide an interactive user experience.
